# Bash F609

## 🤔 Concept
**This repo is automatically installed anything 😐 hopefully**<br />
Basically this script will getting a information or restart your modem<br />

### ✍️ How to install this
```script
git clone https://github.com/Orangeskai/BashF609
```
and change in the .sh file like ip and user password or what information you need (expert)<br />
By default it already showing the Connection 1 which include : <br />
IP Version, IP, IPv4 Connection Status, IPv4 Online Duration, Disconnect Reason

### ✨ Run this
```shell
GetIp.sh    ---> Get information
Reboot.sh    ---> Restart Modem
```

### ⁉️ Q&A
1. Why you not include it in the app so it just AIO ????<br />
- Good question because im dumb and kinda busy maybe also lazy

2. I had problem or bug please fix this ASAP<br />
- Sorry im kinda busy also after this maybe im not maintain this script anymore
